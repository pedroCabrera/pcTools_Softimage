# pcTools_Softimage
Collection of Tools developed during the last 5 Years for XSI Softimage. Last compatible version XSI 2015, some of them should work on previous versions, but are not officialy supported!

## Content:
	-Lots of undocumented ICE Compounds
	-Some useful scripts
	-Some Python Plugins
	-Some Custom c++ nodes
	-A "NOT STABLE/MEMORY CRAZY" imageIo framework for ICE (maybe to be fixed in a future, if someone is interested, contact me and will share sources )
  
## Resume:
  **As Autodesk discontinues softimage XSI in 2015 this collection is a bit abandoned**.
  This bunch of tools has been developed during 5 years, and had been tested and used by me and other people in **EntropyStudio** so most of then are production proven but other ones are just unfinished or unstable. I will be documenting as much as I can when I have time, wich is not the case right now.
